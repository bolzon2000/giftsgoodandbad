She did not seem super excited when she opened this one, however she used it a lot and really appreciated having it for baseball games. Weather in Seattle in the early spring can be cold and rainy and this blanket kept both the wind and the rain out.

## Stadium Blanket - Notes from manufacturer

> TAME THE ELEMENTS: Orion Outpost Trading Co. is proud to introduce our "Elemental" Stadium Sherpa Blanket. Waterproof, windproof, stain resistant, lightweight and portable. A matching rip-stop bag comes with every blanket that has a shoulder strap, as well as a handle.

OVERSIZED: 56" x 80" large enough for more than 1 person to snuggle in or lay it down as an ULTRA PLUSH picnic blanket.

EXTRA DURABLE RIP-STOP: Expect years of use from our over engineered blanket. Strong, yet thanks to the Sherpa Fleece lining, it's incredibly soft and plush.

SHERPA LEVEL HEAT RETENTION: When it get's cold outside, but the kids have a football game, TRUST our Sherpa fleece to trap your body heat and keep you warm until the clock runs down.

MACHINE WASHABLE & AIR/LOW DRY: give them a wash to soften them even more.
