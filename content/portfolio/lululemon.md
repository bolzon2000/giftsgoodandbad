Cross-fit is again my inspiration for gifts, and I've gone to the Lululemon well a few times for cross-fit workout gear. The one thing I learned with these purchases is that if you choose to get workout tops, get the tight fitting ones that are tight all the way down (apparently you end up being upside down quite a bit with cross-fit and don't want your shirt to fall over your head). These gifts usually go over well.
