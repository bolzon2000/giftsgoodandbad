I thought that this would be a great present and imagined her going for bike rides with the kids! She doesn't do that very often, but at least she has the option. Have to admit it's a bit painful to have to pump the tires when she wants to ride it! Still, I'd rate this gift a solid 6 out of 10. The mountain bike pictured is the closest one that I could find to the one I bought (price range was about the same).
