Apparently cross-fit people love hydro flask water bottles. Not sure why, but given that she loves cross-fit, I'm going to give this gift a try. Will update the site once I give it to her. Wish me luck!

## Hydro Flask - Manufacturer Overview

>Hydro Flask Double Wall Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Sports Water Bottle, Wide Mouth with BPA Free Straw Lid

- DESIGN IN MIND: With it's easy-access wide mouth, the sleek design holds the same volume of liquid as other leading water bottle brands. Also, safety is top-of-mind, as the bottles are made out of non-toxic BPA-free plastics & 18/8 food-grade stainless steel.
SLIP-FREE GRIP: Unlike other leading water bottles, Hydro Flask has a powder coat, which gives you a solid grip. The Powder Coat works with the premium TempShield insulation, which prevents condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle, to give you exactly what you want in an everyday refreshment delivery system.
- JUST THE RIGHT SIZE: Meets your everyday hydration needs in one container, all while keeping it piping hot or ice cold and fitting comfortable and conveniently in your hand or your vehicles' cup holders. The wide mouth aspect also fits most backcountry water filters.
- INSULATION INNOVATION: The double-walled, vacuum insulated TempShield Insulation, the same technology used in all Hydro Flask products, will ensure that your beverage of choice maintains its temperature for many hours to come. Hot drinks up to 6 hours, and cold drinks up to 24 hours.
- DRINK IT IN: The durable Wide Mouth Straw Lid lets you add perfect sipping to all your outdoor adventures. It works with all Wide Mouth bottles and, thanks to the handy finger loop, you can clip your favorite Hydro Flask to your pack. Please note that the Wide Mouth Straw Lid is not leak-proof.
